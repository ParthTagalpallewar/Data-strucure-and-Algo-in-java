* How to Find the Greatest Common Divisor?

For a set of two positive integers (a, b) we use the below-given steps to find the greatest common divisor:

Step 1: Write the divisors of positive integer "a".
Step 2: Write the divisors of positive integer "b".
Step 3: Enlist the common divisors of "a" and "b".
Step 4: Now find the divisor which is the highest of both "a" and "b".

Example: Find the greatest common divisor of 13 and 48.
Solution: We will use the below steps to determine the greatest common divisor of (13, 48).

Divisors of 13 are 1, and 13.
Divisors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 48.

The common divisor of 13 and 48 is 1.
The greatest common divisor of 13 and 48 is 1.

Thus, GCD(13, 48) = 1.
