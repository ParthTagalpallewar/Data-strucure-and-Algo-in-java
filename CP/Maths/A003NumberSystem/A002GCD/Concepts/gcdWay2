* Finding Greatest Common Divisor by LCM Method

As per the LCM Method for the greatest common divisor, 
the GCD of two positive integers (a, b) can be calculated by using the following formula:

        GCD (a, b) = a * b / lcm(a, b)



Greatest Common Divisor using LCM Method

The steps to calculate the GCD of (a, b) using the LCM method is:

Step 1: Find the product of a and b.
Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.
Step 3: Divide the values obtained in Step 1 and Step 2.
Step 4: The obtained value after division is the greatest common divisor of (a, b).
Example: Find the greatest common divisor of 15 and 70 using the LCM method.
Solution: The greatest common divisor of 15 and 70 can be calculated as:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The product of 15 and 70 is given as, 15 × 70

The LCM of (15, 70) is 210.

GCD (15, 20) = (15 × 70)/ 210 = 5.

∴ The greatest common divisor of (15, 70) is 5.
