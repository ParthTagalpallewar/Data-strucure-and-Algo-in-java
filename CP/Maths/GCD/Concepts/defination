GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) or GCF (Greatest Common Factor)

* For a set of positive integers (a, b), the greatest common divisor is defined as the greatest positive number which is a common factor of both the positive integers (a, b). 

*  GCD of any two numbers is never negative or 0 as the least positive integer common to any two numbers is always 1.

* There are two ways to determine the greatest common divisor of two numbers:

    * By finding the common divisors
    * By Euclid's algorithm
